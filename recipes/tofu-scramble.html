        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This vegan tofu scramble is super eggy you guys, without having any trace of actual eggs in it!</p>
        <p>I wanted to make a tofu scramble that was really really the most like an egg scramble that I could make it.</p>

        <h2>Ingrediants</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>8 ounces Extra Firm Tofu (226g)</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp Vegan Butter</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp Nutritional Yeast</li>
            <li>½ tsp Turmeric</li>
            <li>½ tsp Paprika</li>
            <li>1 tsp Dijon Mustard</li>
            <li>½ tsp Garlic Powder</li>
            <li>¼ tsp Black Salt Kala Namak</li>
            <li>¼ tsp Onion Powder</li>
            <li>⅓ cup Soy Milk (80ml)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mash the tofu with a fork but leave some nice big chunks.</li>
            <li>Add the nutritional yeast, turmeric, paprika, dijon mustard, garlic powder, black salt and onion powder to a bowl. Then add the soy milk and whisk it in so you have a nice sauce.</li>
            <li>Add the vegan butter to a frying pan and heat until hot. Add the tofu and fry it until lightly browned, being careful not to break it up too much when moving it around the pan.</li>
            <li>Add the sauce and fold it in. Fry it until you’ve achieved desired consistency, the tofu will absorb the sauce so you can have it as wet or as dry as you like.</li>
            <li>Top with some black pepper and chopped chives and serve with some fried tomatoes and sliced avocado.</li>
        </ol>
