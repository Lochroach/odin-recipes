        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>When your busy, seriously amazing sister who’s chasing around two beautiful kids (4 and 2 years old) all day asks if you could make her an overnight oats recipe to make morning mealtime easier, for goodness sake, you make the woman some overnight oats.</p>
        <p>This version is as simple as it gets: <strong>5 ingredients</strong>, <strong>5 minutes prep time</strong>, no fancy methods, and simple ingredients. Let’s do this!</p>
        <h2>Ingrediants</h2>
        <h3>Oats</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup unsweetened plain almond milk (or sub other dairy-free milks, such as coconut, soy, or hemp!)</li>
            <li>3/4 Tbsp chia seeds</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp natural salted peanut butter or almond butter (creamy or crunchy // or sub other nut or seed butter)</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp maple syrup (or sub coconut sugar, organic brown sugar, or stevia to taste)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup gluten-free rolled oats (rolled oats are best, vs. steel cut or quick cooking)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Toppings</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Sliced banana, strawberries, or raspberries</li>
            <li>Flaxseed meal or additional chia seeds</li>
            <li>Granola</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To a mason jar or small bowl with a lid, add almond milk, chia seeds, peanut butter, and maple syrup (or other sweetener) and stir with a spoon to combine. The peanut butter doesn’t need to be completely mixed with the almond milk (doing so leaves swirls of peanut butter to enjoy the next day).</li>
            <li>Add oats and stir a few more times. Then press down with a spoon to ensure all oats have been moistened and are immersed in almond milk.</li>
            <li>Cover securely with a lid or seal and set in the refrigerator overnight (or for at least 6 hours) to set/soak.</li>
            <li>The next day, open and enjoy as is or garnish with desired toppings (see options above). See more flavor/topping suggestions in the blog post above!</li>
            <p><strong>OPTIONAL: You can also heat your oats</strong> in the microwave for 45-60 seconds (just ensure there’s enough room at the top of your jar to allow for expansion and prevent overflow), or transfer oats to a saucepan and heat over medium heat until warmed through. Add more liquid as needed if oats get too thick/dry.</p>
            <li>Overnight oats will keep in the refrigerator for 2-3 days, though best within the first 12-24 hours in our experience. Not freezer friendly.</li>
        </ol>
